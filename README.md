# CalendarComponent
Vanilla Implementation of a calendar based on some received inputs

This component was requested as a task to be able to apply for a position as a junior programmer in a formal company, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.

### Indications

Create a calendar that is displayed after entering a value of an initial date and a number of days.


After pressing a button, it will display:

- Days outside the calendar month in gray color.
- Weekend days in yellow color.
- Days from Monday to Friday in green color.
- Holidays in orange color.
- Selected days during the week in red color (if it is another previous one, show the color corresponding to the other case and not red).
- If the number of days is greater than the number of days that can be shown in the month, show more calendars until all days can be shown.
- If you show months from different years, show different years.
- Each calendar must have the name of the month as its header, as well as the days of the week.
